This project explores detecting malicious or phishing URLs using machine learning.

## Current Status

- Dataset loading and exploration
- Understanding class distribution and basic URL characteristics

## Dataset

The dataset contains URLs labeled as benign or malicious and is used for supervised learning experiments.

## Next Steps

- Feature engineering on URLs (keywords, structure)
- Baseline ML model training
